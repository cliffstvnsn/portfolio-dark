# My Porfolio

## This React.js project was designed so that colleagues and other professionals can see who I am, contact me and provide feedback on current projects.  

Designed my portfolio website with React (Vite) and deployed with hostinger. Initialized a working contact-me form with GetForm and linked all my socials and resume. It's styled with react-icons and is fully responsive for mobile devices and all screen sizes.
